            <p>While thousands of bands and musicians have been forced to cancel or postpone tours in the face of
                COVID-19, Steve Vai counts himself as one of the lucky ones – he had no live dates on the books for
                2020. However, the global pandemic did throw a rather sizeable wrench into an elaborate recording
                project he had been planning.</p>
            <p>“I was going to be in Europe for four weeks recording my orchestra music with the Metropole Orchestra in
                Holland and the Aarhus Denmark Radio Symphony,” the guitarist says. “It was supposed to kick off the
                last week of May and go all the way through June. It’s about four hours of orchestra music that I have
                that I haven’t released yet. It’s been performed, and some of the compositions are orchestrations of
                songs like Velorum, Call It Sleep and other selections from my catalogue. Probably about two-thirds of
                it is pretty intense, complex and dense, contemporary orchestra music. That I had to postpone. It’s fine
                – it’s just what is.”</p>
            <p>Speaking from his Los Angeles home, Vai reports that the ongoing lockdown hasn’t affected his day-to-day
                life to any great extent. “I’m fortunate. I haven’t gotten sick, at least not that I know of,” he says.
                “For me, it’s relatively business as usual because I live in my studio anyway. I roll with the punches
                and I don’t even feel them as punches.</p>
